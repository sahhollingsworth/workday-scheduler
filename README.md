## Summary
* The planner displays the current date at the top and timeblocks for each standard business hour are visible upon scroll.
* Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future in relation to the users current time.
* To input an event, the user clicks a timeblock and types in description.
* When a user saves a timeblock using the save button, the text for that event is saved in local storage.
* Saved events persist, regardless of page refresh.
