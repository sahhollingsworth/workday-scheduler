## Summary
* The planner displays the current date at the top of the calendar
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar and timeblocks for standard business hours are visible upon scroll
* Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future in relation to the users current time.
* To input an event, the user clicks a timeblock
* When a user saves a timeblock using the save button, the text for that event is saved in local storage
* Saved events persist, regardless of page refresh.
